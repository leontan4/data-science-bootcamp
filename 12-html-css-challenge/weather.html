                <p>This is the humidity graph that is comparing the humidity of coutries based on their latitude. As we can see from the graph, 
                                        countries that falls near to the equator has a high temperature and low wind speed. Also, these countries do not have winter season and mostly "summer" throughout the year. It make sense though because countries near to the equator are Asian countries, such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia. However, if we look into the globe and noticed China, the part of the country that has higher latitude would have a lower temperature and winter season.
